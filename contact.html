          <h2><span>Banks should lead the way in terms of Sustainable Finance in Risk Management.</span></h2> <br>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>Climate protection and sustainable business practices have risen to the top of bank boards' priority lists. This is due in part to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has become all too clear how quickly - and with previously unimaginable force - severe health and environmental risks can impact societies and economies. The world is changing at an astonishing rate, rapidly reshaping today's cultural consciousness and business environment. </p>
          <p>While many industries, such as transportation and real estate, are already impacted by the need to meet climate targets, we are now seeing the emergence of consumers and investors demanding a shift toward sustainability from the financial industry as well.</p>
          <p>To its credit, the banking industry recognizes this need as well. According to a recent survey conducted by the Association of German Banks, the vast majority of financial institutions expect to see noticeable and potentially serious effects from climate change on their businesses over the next ten years. Politicians and bank regulators have taken notice as well.</p>
          <p>We believe that banks should take the lead in developing appropriate solutions to the challenges of sustainable finance. Such proactive efforts will lead to the creation of new business opportunities. We strongly advise bankers to begin reviewing their business models and strategies in light of this. </p> 
          <p>Another important emerging area in risk management and sustainable finance is disclosure. Because of the well-known relationship between real estate portfolios and climate change, this information is receiving special attention. These requirements are in the process of being formalized. There are currently no market standards for such reporting. </p> 
          <p>It would serve the interests of banks to set up their own solid reporting systems for dealing with sustainability as soon as possible. Excellence in providing concrete information regarding the ramifications of sustainability will most certainly be recognised as a very real competitive edge in the near future. <p> 
          <p>Banks would benefit from establishing their own solid reporting systems for dealing with sustainability as soon as possible. Excellence in providing concrete information about the implications of sustainability will undoubtedly be recognized as a significant competitive advantage in the near future. <p>
